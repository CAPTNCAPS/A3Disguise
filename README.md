# A3 Disguise
I made this script to recreate the functionality seen in early previews ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efC6gAO6exA  at 1:50 ).  
The systems in this script try to recreate the feel of "Death to Spies". Meaning you can steal different uniforms to get into different areas (work in progress) and enemies get suspicious when you show up wearing the wrong gear or holding an opfor weapon.  

## Multiplayer 
Eventually I want the mod to work in multiplayer, but it needs a lot of work, so right now I do not guarantee it.  
The "master" branch is old and WILL NEVER WORK in MP! Check the "addon" branch for new developments!

## Branches
The "master" branch is for the vanilla game and uses a very old version of the script, which has to be added to each mission.  
Check the "addon" branch for a more up-to-date version, which is loaded as a mod and provides modules for use in your mission.

## Mods
I do not guarantee compatibility with mods. Especially AI mods. A3Disguise makes the AI dumb on purpose and WILL break your AI mods!  
It should work with modded gear and weapons though.
