# A3 Disguise
I made this script to recreate the functionality seen in early previews ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efC6gAO6exA  at 1:50 ).  
The systems in this script try to recreate the feel of "Death to Spies". Meaning you can steal different uniforms to get into different areas (work in progress) and enemies get suspicious when you show up wearing the wrong gear or holding an opfor weapon.  

## Multiplayer 
The script currently only works in singleplayer, but will be expanded to work in multiplayer in the future.  
Check out the "master" branch for a really old version which might work in multiplayer.  

## Branches
This branch is for the global mobilization addon, meaning it will only work with GM uniforms, helmets, weapons, etc. Everybody WILL be suspicious if you carry any non-GM gear! (no mods, no vanilla gear!)  
Check the master branch for Vanilla support (really old script!).  

## Mods
This script cannot possibly be compatible with mods because checking gear requires manually making a list of the classnames (since weapons and gear are not ususally sorted by sides).  
Feel free to modify the script to include classnames of any mods you use.
